10-hour design competition where we had to follow design constraints. 
The device we made was an automatic motion-detected door. 
This would stay open as long as a motion was detected. 
There was also a remote controller which would control whether the door was open, closed, or motion-detected mode.
This device included an STM Nucleo-32 Microprocessor, PIR sensor, IR sensor and various other components.
This was coded on the ARDUINO IDE, however downloaded librarys for our microcontroller
We place top 5 in the competition.
